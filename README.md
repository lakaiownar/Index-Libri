Index-Libri is a Backend and Frontend web-app that will keep track of books a user will be reading. 
It will also need a user to authenticate themselves via Google OAuth2 in order to access the app. 
The goal of this web-app is to allow for Google Books to recommend liked books by the user. 
Moreover there will be an attempt to use the Readarr api to fetch books that will be requested.
There is also going to be a simple redirection to a Calibre-web server that the user will be able to point to wherever they are hosting it.
